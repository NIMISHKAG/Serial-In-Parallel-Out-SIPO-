# Serial-In-Parallel-Out-SIPO-
D flip-flops to create a four-bit SIPO shift register module. The input to the module is a single bit of serial data, which is loaded into the first flip-flop on the clock edge. The output of each flip-flop is connected to a separate output port to provide parallel output.
